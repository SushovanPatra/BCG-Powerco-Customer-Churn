# BCG-ViRTUAL-OPEn-ACCESS-INTERNSHIP
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. 
The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. 
They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn 
using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to 
churn a 20% discount might be effective.

The Lead Data Scientist (LDS) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, 
you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. 


TASK1 -- Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email 
          to your LDS, focusing on the potential data that you would need from the client and analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.
          
TASK2--
      Sub-Task 1:

      Clean the data – you might have to address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers.

      Sub-Task 2:

      Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. 
      Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.

TASK3:
      Sub-task 1: Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client

      Sub-task 2: Build the features in order to get ready to model

TASK 4:
      Sub-Task 1:

      Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables you have constructed in the
      feature engineering process.

      Sub-Task 2:

      Evaluate your model, using a holdout set, and with metrics of your choosing. Be sure to pick a metric that would make sense for this business case.

      Sub-Task 3:

      Interpret the results and use them to formulate your answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions. You will be asked to form these answers into coherent 
      thoughts and recommendations in the next module.

TASK 5

  Develop an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the steering committee meeting 
  which the head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.
